22/09/23, 11:20 pm - Shiv Shankar: is it
22/09/23, 11:20 pm - Gayathri: I don't know if there was supposed to be an explanation under all of it, but I think I got the gist of it
22/09/23, 11:21 pm - Shiv Shankar: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 11:21 pm - Gayathri: It was very disturbing in the beginning, little funny in the middle and sad at the end
22/09/23, 11:21 pm - Gayathri: Overall a good movie but not the best movie to watch before sleep
22/09/23, 11:21 pm - Gayathri: No it was fine
22/09/23, 11:22 pm - Shiv Shankar: it also implicates his three elder siblings also tried to play god and met the same fate
22/09/23, 11:24 pm - Gayathri: Ohhh okay
22/09/23, 11:24 pm - Gayathri: This is what made you think?

22/09/23, 11:24 pm - Shiv Shankar: yeah
22/09/23, 11:25 pm - Gayathri: Okay, it s a little like inception hub, have to watch 3 times to "get it"
22/09/23, 11:26 pm - Shiv Shankar: maybe
22/09/23, 11:27 pm - Shiv Shankar: he wanted to save everyone and have the best for himself at the same time all at once
22/09/23, 11:28 pm - Shiv Shankar: so ultimately the best world was the one without him
22/09/23, 11:28 pm - Gayathri: Yup understood, in that handicapped part especially
22/09/23, 11:29 pm - Shiv Shankar: that horoscope lady once tells him he doesnt have a soul and isnt supposed to be alive
22/09/23, 11:29 pm - Shiv Shankar: and his mom reveals she had 3 still births previously
22/09/23, 11:29 pm - Gayathri: Yes, it was funny 😂
22/09/23, 11:29 pm - Gayathri: Yeah she says 2 then then at last when he chokes himself it was 3
22/09/23, 11:30 pm - Shiv Shankar: oh
22/09/23, 11:30 pm - Shiv Shankar: i forgot
22/09/23, 11:30 pm - Gayathri: Ohhh but you remember so much of it

22/09/23, 11:30 pm - Shiv Shankar: made me start thinking
22/09/23, 11:31 pm - Gayathri: Ohhh okay okay 😂
22/09/23, 11:31 pm - Gayathri: No he says something funny back to her
22/09/23, 11:31 pm - Shiv Shankar: oh
22/09/23, 11:31 pm - Shiv Shankar: what was his reply
22/09/23, 11:31 pm - Gayathri: Like I am going to take back my 10 dollars
22/09/23, 11:31 pm - Gayathri: For this
22/09/23, 11:31 pm - Shiv Shankar: oh
22/09/23, 11:32 pm - Shiv Shankar: it became serious as his mom breaks down
22/09/23, 11:32 pm - Gayathri: Ohh yeah
22/09/23, 11:33 pm - Shiv Shankar: ultimately at the end they say that everything is going very well without him and nobody feels anything short in their life
22/09/23, 11:33 pm - Gayathri: Yes that was sad
22/09/23, 11:33 pm - Shiv Shankar: made me think what significance do each of us have in this world#

22/09/23, 11:35 pm - Shiv Shankar: I looked for time travel movies all the time
22/09/23, 11:35 pm - Gayathri: This was more horror to me
22/09/23, 11:36 pm - Shiv Shankar: this one was the best use of my time
22/09/23, 11:36 pm - Shiv Shankar: insidious 1 is the best horror

30/09/23, 12:08 pm - Gayathri: Ohh okay, school friends and all?
30/09/23, 12:08 pm - Shiv Shankar: School friends absolutely no contact
Have to find them on LinkedIn or Instagram or something
30/09/23, 12:09 pm - Gayathri: ohhh ok ok
30/09/23, 12:09 pm - Gayathri: I have like two contacts from my school, whom I will also probably invite online
30/09/23, 12:09 pm - Shiv Shankar: Oh nice

30/09/23, 12:31 pm - Shiv Shankar: During undergrad college 2nd year
30/09/23, 12:32 pm - Shiv Shankar: Those were some highly ambitious times

30/09/23, 12:33 pm - Gayathri: Wrote
30/09/23, 12:33 pm - Shiv Shankar: Japanese because I started watching anime 
So wanted some relevancy. 
But it is highly complicated. Stopped learning when I saw two different scripts
30/09/23, 12:33 pm - Shiv Shankar: No
30/09/23, 12:33 pm - Gayathri: Ohhh ok ok
30/09/23, 12:33 pm - Shiv Shankar: Started learning Spanish after I started watching daredevil in Hot star
30/09/23, 12:34 pm - Shiv Shankar: And French was the first suggestion in duolimgo
30/09/23, 12:34 pm - Gayathri: Ohh that marvel lawyer?
30/09/23, 12:34 pm - Gayathri: Huh ohhh ok ok
30/09/23, 12:34 pm - Shiv Shankar: After a while French started getting difficult
30/09/23, 12:35 pm - Shiv Shankar: Couldn't understand the words from audio
30/09/23, 12:36 pm - Gayathri: Ohhh okay
30/09/23, 12:36 pm - Shiv Shankar: Hard to guess which words are which
30/09/23, 12:36 pm - Gayathri: I also learnt a little bit of french from duolingo
30/09/23, 12:36 pm - Gayathri: That's all I know in foreign languagee
30/09/23, 12:36 pm - Shiv Shankar: Yayyy
30/09/23, 12:37 pm - Shiv Shankar: As of now all of my learnings are in suspension
30/09/23, 12:37 pm - Gayathri: ohhh awww
30/09/23, 12:37 pm - Shiv Shankar: Suspended indefinitely
30/09/23, 12:37 pm - Gayathri: I mean you are learning on the job right? Thats new for you right?
30/09/23, 12:38 pm - Shiv Shankar: Which job

30/09/23, 8:15 pm - Shiv Shankar: same sandeep reddy
30/09/23, 8:16 pm - Shiv Shankar: dont know how much he had to compromise in his script in accommodating the kapoors
30/09/23, 8:16 pm - Gayathri: What do you mean?
30/09/23, 8:16 pm - Gayathri: This already looks wayyy out of ranbirs normal movies
30/09/23, 8:17 pm - Shiv Shankar: yeah it happens in bol,ywood
30/09/23, 8:17 pm - Gayathri: You will like the film i think
30/09/23, 8:17 pm - Shiv Shankar: have to see
30/09/23, 8:17 pm - Gayathri: Happens here in kollywood too right, for vijay s beast Nelson accomodated
30/09/23, 8:17 pm - Shiv Shankar: it was specifically designed for vijay i think
30/09/23, 8:18 pm - Gayathri: Ohhh, then they didn't design it properly😂
30/09/23, 8:18 pm - Shiv Shankar: heroes approach nelson not the other way around
30/09/23, 8:18 pm - Shiv Shankar: actors*
30/09/23, 8:19 pm - Gayathri: Ohhh okay
30/09/23, 8:20 pm - Gayathri: Did you like arjun reddy?
30/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shiv Shankar: yeah very much
30/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shiv Shankar: i mean i watched kabir singh
30/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shiv Shankar: same ditoo
30/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shiv Shankar: ditto
30/09/23, 8:20 pm - Gayathri: Yeah
30/09/23, 8:21 pm - Gayathri: Ohhhh which aspect, i liked the first part then the second part was a srag
30/09/23, 8:21 pm - Gayathri: Drag
30/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shiv Shankar: i liked the part where they both were loyal to the end
30/09/23, 8:23 pm - Gayathri: He was loyal? 😂 okay
30/09/23, 8:24 pm - Shiv Shankar: yeah
30/09/23, 8:24 pm - Shiv Shankar: actually in script he was loyal I saw sandeep reddy's interview
30/09/23, 8:24 pm - Shiv Shankar: those masala bits were extra
30/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shiv Shankar: he does nothing actually
30/09/23, 8:25 pm - Gayathri: Ohhh i did not know that
30/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shiv Shankar: yeah
30/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shiv Shankar: he was interviewed after kabir singh
30/09/23, 8:27 pm - Gayathri: The only interview thing that made rounds was him saying slapping was also a form of expressing love
30/09/23, 8:27 pm - Gayathri: Which did not go well for him
30/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shiv Shankar: yeah I agree with him but it is public reaction
30/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shiv Shankar: they both slapped each other
30/09/23, 8:29 pm - Gayathri: Why would slapping be a form of expressing love
30/09/23, 8:29 pm - Gayathri: It's just anger
30/09/23, 8:48 pm - Shiv Shankar: You have the right to be angry
30/09/23, 8:51 pm - Gayathri: Okay fine. 
If it were up to me, instead of both of them slapping each other, not slapping each other would be the ideal scenario <This message was edited>
30/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shiv Shankar: if they are upset with each other showing their anger is fine
30/09/23, 8:54 pm - Shiv Shankar: showing all forms of expressions must be allowed and you must be comfortable expressing any type of feeling to your better half
30/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shiv Shankar: if some forms of expressions are not allowed
then it is a contract
contracts have an expiration date
30/09/23, 8:57 pm - Gayathri: I would argue, other than physical form any other form is fine. Since I watched this series on domestic violence called the Maid, I have been a little cautious about domestic violence
30/09/23, 8:59 pm - Shiv Shankar: domestic violence is entirely different 
one slap from arjun reddy is not equivalent to domestic violence
30/09/23, 8:59 pm - Shiv Shankar: A woman named tapsee pannu has acted in a movie in this aspect only
it failed miserably
30/09/23, 9:04 pm - Gayathri: I mean after that one slap, it's the uncertainty of he might slap again or something else which is terrifying for me
30/09/23, 9:04 pm - Gayathri: Yeah I know
30/09/23, 9:05 pm - Gayathri: Had dinner?
30/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shiv Shankar: about to
30/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shiv Shankar: what about you
30/09/23, 9:05 pm - Gayathri: Yet to.
Parents have gone to collect the invitation cards
